Designing an Automated Time Table following the Software Engineering principles from Requirement Analysis,Designing,Coding to actual Deployment. The crux of the project is implementation of Genetic Algorithm which is a heuristic algorithm based on Natural Selection results in Randomized and Optimized output, generally used for larger search space.
The algorithm takes input from the Requirements phase and classifies into hard and soft constraints and try to satisfy most of the constraints.
